This is a website developed for Flamingo Feathers.

Flamingo Feathers is a recreational resort, located in the north of Utopia. It is know for its collection of the most breath-taking birds found on earth. Flamingo Feathers was made for the love birds, and it abhors bird caging. That is why this place is more like an open cage where birds are kept for display without being caged of their natural ability to fly high. 

The idea of an open cage bird-display was coined by X. Flamingo Feathers was named so, because the first batch of birds imported to be kept here was of flamingoes.

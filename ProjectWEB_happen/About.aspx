    <p>
        Flamingo Feathers is a recreational resort, located in the north of Utopia. It is know for its collection of
        the most breath-taking birds found on earth. Flamingo Feathers was made for the love birds, and it abhors bird caging.
        That is why this place is more like an <i>open cage</i> where birds are kept for display without being caged of their 
        natural ability to fly high.
        
        <br />
        <br />

        The idea of an <i>open cage</i> bird-display was coined by X. Flamingo Feathers was named so, because the first
        batch of birds imported to be kept here was of flamingoes.
